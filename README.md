# Superstore_Analysis
In this repository, I present an analysis of the "superstore_sales.xlsx" file. This dataset contains comprehensive information about orders made in a superstore. The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging popular libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
# Notebook Overview
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
The analysis includes:

- Grouping data using groupby to derive insights.
- Creating bar plots and line plots to visualize trends and patterns in the data.
- Implementing RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis for customer segmentation.
